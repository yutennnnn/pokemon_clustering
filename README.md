# Pokemon Clustering

This project explores clustering techniques on Pokemon data. The goal is to group Pokemon based on their attributes using K-Means and related visualizations.

## Dataset

The dataset `Pokemon.csv` comes from the [Kaggle Pokemon dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abcsds/pokemon). See Kaggle for license and usage information. Images referenced by the notebook (e.g. `data/001_kin.png`) are not included. Obtain them from the same Kaggle dataset or other sources and place them under the `data/` directory.

## Dependencies

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `Pillow`

Install packages with `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn pillow`.

## Usage

Run or view `Pokemon_clustering.ipynb` with Jupyter Notebook. Future scripts will follow the same dependencies and can be run with `python <script.py>`.
