# Pokemon Clustering

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for clustering Pokemon data. 

## Data

The notebook expects PNG images in the `data/` directory. If the images are not present, the notebook automatically skips displaying them. An empty `data/` directory is provided so you can place the required images there if desired.

## Notebook

Open `Pokemon_clustering.ipynb` in Jupyter to run the analysis. Cells that attempt to display Pokemon icons will not fail if the corresponding image file is missing.
